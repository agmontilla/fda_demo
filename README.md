# fda_demo

A fda 2.0 simple demo

## Notes

- There is a bug in [Create Specs](http://furydocs.io/molida/0.0.9-docs/guide/#/from_fda1?id=create-specs) when you're trying to reach the **artifact specification link**
- It is not clear what means "inventory" in [Artifact Specification](http://furydocs.io/molida/0.0.9-docs/guide/#/artifacts?id=artifact-specifications)
- Is it necessary to put a `constructor` value on artifacts specs?
- Is it mandatory to put a python module in `command` section on task specs? (our ETL/Train files are notebooks)
- Is there any key to put a description for input parameters (task specs)?
- What about other files (like SQL or YML files) under fda 2.0?
